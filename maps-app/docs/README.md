## Description

The Maps App is an open source app to show some good practices when building applications around the ArcGIS Runtime SDK for iOS. It also includes a modular UI, components of which can be re-used in your own applications.

Get your organization's authoritative map data into the hands of your workers with this ArcGIS Runtime iOS app. The application you build can include a custom web map from your [ArcGIS Online organization](https://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/reference/what-is-agol.htm). For example, a web map from the [Living Atlas](https://livingatlas.arcgis.com/en/browse/?#d=1&type=maps) can be used as a starting place for your app. The Maps App also includes examples of place search and routing capabilities using either ArcGIS Online's powerful services or your own services. It also leverages your organizations configured basemaps to allow users to switch between the basemap that make sense for them.

Grab the code and either configure the app for your organization, or just learn how to integrate similar capabilities into your own app!

### Using web maps

You can author your own web maps from ArcGIS Online or ArcGIS Pro and share them in your app via your ArcGIS Online organization, this is the central power of the Web GIS model built into ArcGIS. Building an app which uses a web map allows the cartography and map configuration to be completed in ArcGIS Online rather than in code. This then allows the map to change over time, without any code changes or app updates. Learn more about the benefits of developing with web maps [here](https://developers.arcgis.com/web-map-specification/). Also, learn about authoring web maps in [ArcGIS Online](http://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/create-maps/make-your-first-map.htm) and [ArcGIS Pro](http://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/help/mapping/map-authoring/author-a-basemap.htm).

Loading web maps in code is really easy. The maps app loads a web map from a portal (which may require the user to sign in, see the identity section below) with the following code:

```swift
let portal = AGSPortal(url: URL(string: "https://<your portal url>")!, loginRequired: false)
let webMap = AGSPortalItem(portal: portal, itemID: "<your map id>")
mapView.map = AGSMap(item: webMap)
```

### Accessing your organization's basemaps

As an administrator of an ArcGIS Online organization or Portal you can configure the basemaps that your users can switch between via a [group](http://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/share-maps/share-items.htm). Applications can leverage this configuration using the [Portal API](https://developers.arcgis.com/ios/latest/swift/guide/access-the-arcgis-platform.htm#ESRI_SECTION2_B8EDBBD3D4F1499C80AF43CFA73B8292). The Maps App does this by an async call to find the group containing web maps in the basemap gallery. With the returned group id, the collection of basemaps is retrieved from the portal.

```swift
if let basemapGroupQuery = portal.portalInfo?.basemapGalleryGroupQuery {
    let params = AGSPortalQueryParameters(query: basemapGroupQuery)
    portal.findGroups(with: params, completion: { groups, error in
        guard error == nil else {
            print("Unable to get Basemaps Group! \(error!.localizedDescription)")
            return
        }

        guard let basemapGroup = groups?.results?.first as? AGSPortalGroup, let groupID = basemapGroup.groupID else {
            print("No error, but also no Basemap Group query results!")
            return
        }

        let groupParams = AGSPortalQueryParameters(forItemsInGroup: groupID)
        groupParams.limit = 50
        portal.findItems(with: groupParams, completion: { groupQueryResults, error in
            guard error == nil else {
                print("Error loading items for basemap group: \(error!.localizedDescription)")
                return
            }

            guard let basemapItems = groupQueryResults?.results as? [AGSPortalItem] else {
                print("Basemap results were not a set of AGSPortalItems")
                return
            }

            // Display the basemaps in a basemaps picker...
        })
    })
}
```

### Identity

The Maps App leverages the ArcGIS [identity](https://developers.arcgis.com/authentication/) model to provide access to resources via the the [named user](https://developers.arcgis.com/documentation/core-concepts/security-and-authentication/#named-user-login) login pattern. During the routing workflow, the app prompts you for your organization’s ArcGIS Online credentials used to obtain a token later consumed by the Portal and routing service. The ArcGIS Runtime SDKs provide a simple to use API for dealing with ArcGIS logins.

The process of accessing token secured services with a challenge handler is illustrated in the following diagram.

![](/docs/images/identity.png)

1. A request is made to a secured resource.
2. The portal responds with an unauthorized access error.
3. A challenge handler associated with the identity manager is asked to provide a credential for the portal.
4. A UI displays and the user is prompted to enter a user name and password.
5. If the user is successfully authenticated, a credential (token) is included in requests to the secured service.
6. The identity manager stores the credential for this portal and all requests for secured content includes the token in the request.

The `AGSOAuthConfiguration` class takes care of steps 1-6 in the diagram above. For an application to use this pattern, follow these [guides](https://developers.arcgis.com/authentication/signing-in-arcgis-online-users/) to register your app.

```swift
let oauthConfig = AGSOAuthConfiguration(portalURL: portal.url, clientID: clientId, redirectURL: oAuthRedirectURL)
AGSAuthenticationManager.shared().oAuthConfigurations.add(oauthConfig)
```

Any time a secured service issues an authentication challenge, the `AGSOAuthConfiguration` and the app's `UIApplicationDelegate` work together to broker the authentication transaction. The `oAuthRedirectURL` above tells iOS how to call back to the Maps App to confirm authentication with the Runtime SDK.

iOS knows to call the `UIApplicationDelegate` with this URL, and we pass that directly to an ArcGIS Runtime SDK helper function to retrieve a token:

```swift
// UIApplicationDelegate function called when "maps-app-ios://auth" is opened.
func application(_ app: UIApplication, open url: URL, options: [UIApplicationOpenURLOptionsKey : Any] = [:]) -> Bool {
    // Pass the OAuth callback through to the ArcGIS Runtime helper function
    AGSApplicationDelegate.shared().application(app, open: url, options: options)

    // Let iOS know we handled the URL OK
    return true
}
```

To tell iOS to call back like this, the Maps App configures a `URL Type` in the `Info.plist` file.

![OAuth URL Type](/docs/images/configure-url-type.png)

Note the value for URL Schemes. Combined with the text `auth` to make `maps-app-ios://auth`, this is the [redirect URI](https://developers.arcgis.com/authentication/browser-based-user-logins/#configuring-a-redirect-uri) that you configured when you registered your app [here](https://developers.arcgis.com/dashboard/). For more details on the user authorization flow, see the [Authorize REST API](https://developers.arcgis.com/rest/users-groups-and-items/authorize.htm).

For more details on configuring the Maps App for OAuth, see [the main README.md](/README.md#2-configuring-the-project)

### Place search & geocoding

[Geocoding](https://developers.arcgis.com/ios/latest/swift/guide/search-for-places-geocoding-.htm) lets you transform an address or a place name to a specific geographic location. The reverse lets you use a geographic location to find a description of the location, like a postal address or place name. In the Maps App, we use a [AGSLocatorTask](https://developers.arcgis.com/ios/latest/swift/guide/search-for-places-geocoding-.htm#ESRI_SECTION1_62AE6A47EB4B403ABBC72337A1255F8A) to perform geocoding and reverse geocoding functions provided by [Esri's World Geocoding Service](https://developers.arcgis.com/features/geocoding/). The `AGSLocatorTask` has various asynchronous methods that we use to provide address suggestions when searching for places or geocoding locations.

You can also provision your own [custom geocode service](https://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/administer/configure-services.htm#ESRI_SECTION1_0A9A071A7AB748028C8213D1D863FA18) to support your organization. Maps App reads the first locator from the list of locators provisioned for an ArcGIS Online organization or Portal.

```swift
if let geocoderURL = portal.portalInfo?.helperServices?.geocodeServiceURLs?.first {
    locator = AGSLocatorTask(url: geocoderURL)
}
```

Before using the `AGSLocatorTask` to geocode or search for places, it must be LOADED. The loadable pattern is described [here](https://developers.arcgis.com/ios/latest/swift/guide/loadable-pattern.htm).

The ArcGIS Runtime SDK for iOS is implemented so that any action on a loadable task is queued internally until the task is loaded. This means that you can safely write code like the following and allow the ArcGIS Runtime to handle the load behind the scenes before any geocode request is sent:

```swift
func search(searchText:String) {
    locator.geocode(withSearchText: searchText, parameters: params) { results, error in
        guard error == nil else {
            // This could be a load error OR a search error...
            print("Error performing search! \(error!.localizedDescription)")
            return
        }

        if let result = results?.first {
            // Do something with the result...
        } else {
            print("\"\(searchText)\" returned no results.")
        }
    }
}
```

 If the `AGSLocatorTask` above is already loaded, the ArcGIS Runtime SDK doesn't try to load again but moves straight on to the actual geocode.

### Place suggestions

Typing the first few letters of a place into the Map App search box (e.g. “Central Park”) shows a number of suggestions near the device’s location.

![](/docs/images/app-suggestions.png)

This is a simple call on the `AGSLocatorTask`:

```swift
func getSuggestions(forSearchText searchText:String) {
    locator.suggest(withSearchText: searchText) { suggestions, error in
        guard error == nil else {
            // This could be a load error OR a suggestions error...
            print("Error getting suggestions for \"\(searchText)\": \(error!.localizedDescription)")
            return
        }

        // ...Display the suggestions for the user to pick one...
    }
}
```

If there is a property you need to read before calling an async action on the loadable task, then you must explicitly load the task (in the following code, the above code is updated slightly to determine whether the locator supports interactive suggestions):

```swift
func getSuggestions(forSearchText searchText:String) {
    locator.load { error in
        guard error == nil else {
            // This is a load error...
            print("Error loading locator: \(error!.localizedDescription)")
            return
        }

        guard self.locator.locatorInfo?.supportsSuggestions == true else {
            return
        }

        self.locator.suggest(withSearchText: searchText) { suggestions, error in
            // This is a suggestions error...
            // Any load error would have been caught above...
            guard error == nil else {
                print("Error getting suggestions for \"\(searchText)\": \(error!.localizedDescription)")
                return
            }

            // ...Display the suggestions for the user to pick one...
        }
    }
}
```

Note how the above two patterns work to coalesce loading and asynchronous actions. Understanding this can guide how you might present errors to the user.

### Searching from a suggestion

Once a suggestion in the list has been selected by the user, the suggested address is geocoded using the geocode function of the `AGSLocatorTask`. Along with the address, specific [geocoding parameters](https://developers.arcgis.com/ios/latest/swift/guide/search-for-places-geocoding-.htm#ESRI_SECTION2_48C5C281B21B4BF1BBBDBCEA71F105B9) can be set to tune the results. For example, in the maps app, we set the [preferred location](https://developers.arcgis.com/ios/latest/api-reference/interface_a_g_s_geocode_parameters.html#a8d2dbede94ed26ecde13f9d766d767e2) to prioritize results closer to the center of the map.

```swift
func search(suggestion:AGSSuggestResult) {
    let params = AGSGeocodeParameters()
    if let center = mapView.currentViewpoint(with: .centerAndScale)?.targetGeometry as? AGSPoint {
        params.preferredSearchLocation = center
    }

    locator.geocode(with: suggestion, parameters: params) { results, error in
        guard error == nil else {
            print("Error performing search from suggestion \(suggestion.label)! \(error!.localizedDescription)")
            return
        }

        if let result = results?.first {
            // Do something with the result...
        } else {
            print("\"\(searchText)\" returned no results.")
        }
    }
}
```

### Reverse geocoding

The Map App uses the built-in map magnifier to help users fine tune a location on the map for reverse geocoding. The magnifier appears after a long-press on the map view. Once the long-press is released, the map point is reverse geocoded.

On long press                          | Reverse geocode result
:-------------------------------------:|:-------------------------------------:
![](/docs/images/app-reverse-geocode-magnifier.png)              | ![](/docs/images/app-reverse-geocode-result.png)

By default the ArcGIS Runtime SDK for iOS will display the magnifier on a long press. We’ve told the `AGSMapView` touch delegate to do a reverse geocode when the long press ends.

```swift
func viewDidLoad() {
    super.viewDidLoad()

    // ... set up the Maps App Map View Controller ...

    mapView.touchDelegate = self
}

func geoView(_ geoView: AGSGeoView, didEndLongPressAtScreenPoint screenPoint: CGPoint, mapPoint: AGSPoint) {
    locator.reverseGeocode(withLocation: mapPoint) { results, error in
        guard error == nil else {
            print("Error reverse geocoding from \(mapPoint): \(error!.localizedDescription)")
            return
        }

        guard let result = results?.first else {
            return
        }

        // Do something with the result...
    }
}
```

### Route

Getting navigation directions in the Maps App is just as easy in the [Runtime SDK](https://developers.arcgis.com/features/directions/) as it is on [ArcGIS Online](http://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/use-maps/get-directions.htm). You can [customize](http://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/administer/configure-services.htm#ESRI_SECTION1_567C344D5DEE444988CA2FE5193F3CAD) your navigation service for your organization, add new travel modes that better reflect your organization’s workflows, or remove travel modes that are not suitable for your organization’s workflows.

Navigating from point to point in the Map App is enabled by first geocoding or reverse geocoding a location. You can then get directions to that location from the current GPS location (or if GPS is disabled, from the center of the map). In the Maps App, routing requires you to provide credentials to your Portal or ArcGIS Online organization. As mentioned earlier in the Identity section above, we use the `AGSOAuthConfiguration` object to manage the authentication process.

```swift
if let routeTaskURL = portal.portalInfo?.helperServices?.routeServiceURL {
    routeTask = AGSRouteTask(url: routeTaskURL)
}
```

You can instantiate a new `AGSRouteParameters` object by using the `defaultRouteParameters()` function on the `AGSRouteTask` instance. This retrieves the appropriate default settings for the route service. We then add the stops and request route directions. The default parameters are loaded when the `AGSRouteTask` loads, and are cached for subsequent calls, so once the `AGSRouteTask` has loaded its metadata once from the REST service, the following code will move immediately on to solving the route:

```swift
func requestRoute(from:AGSStop, to:AGSStop) {
    routeTask.defaultRouteParameters() { defaultParams, error in
        guard error == nil else {
            print("Error getting default parameters: \(error!.localizedDescription)")
            return
        }

        // To make best use of the service, we will base our request off the service's default parameters.
        guard let params = defaultParams else {
            print("No default parameters available.")
            return
        }

        params.returnStops = true
        params.returnDirections = true
        params.returnRoutes = true
        params.setStops([from,to])
        params.outputSpatialReference = mapView.spatialReference

        self.routeTask.solveRoute(with: params) { result, error in
            guard error == nil else {
                print("Error solving route between \(from) and \(to): \(error!.localizedDescription)")
                return
            }

            guard let routeResult = result?.routes.first else {
                print("Route result unexpectedly empty between \(from) and \(to)")
                return
            }

            // Do something with the route result
        }
    }

}
```

The resulting route is shown:

![](/docs/images/app-directions-result.png)

## Architecture

The Maps App is built around 4 core components:

1. A singleton `AppContext` to manage the app's current state.
2. A singleton `ArcGISServices` component to handle geocode and directions calls to the ArcGIS platform.
3. An interactive Map View and controller.
4. A decoupled, modular UI.

Components of the app read from and write to the `AppContext`. Changes to the `AppContext` raise Notifications using iOS's in-built `NSNotificationCenter` to which the UI can react.

![App Architecture](/docs/images/app-architecture.png)

### App lifecycle

When the app starts up, the `MapsAppDelegate` instance is created, which instantiates the `AppContext` and `ArcGISServices` singletons.

iOS calls the MapsAppDelegate's `application(_:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:)` function where the app sets the ArcGIS Runtime License and sets up the initial AGSPortal object. This object will point to either ArcGIS Online or a custom on-premise ArcGIS Portal, depending on any URL stored in the application `info.plist` file.

iOS will then begin setting up the UI. The Maps App is a Single View Application and the main storyboard defines the `MapViewController` and various UI components to go with it.

When the `MapViewController` and UI are initialized, they read the current `AppContext` to initialize their appearance. They then register themselves as observers on specific custom Notifications that indicate changes to the `AppContext` so they can later update their appearance as appropriate whenever the `AppContext` is updated.

### App notifications

iOS Notifications and the NotificationCenter are used throughout the Maps App to inform the UI that state has changed or ArcGIS Service tasks such as Routing or Geocoding have completed. iOS Notifications are abstracted by a strongly-typed architecture (described below).

Notifications include:

| Source | Notifications |
| ------ | ------------- |
| `AppContext` | Login, Logout, New Basemap Selected, New Web Map Selected |
| `ArcGISServices` | Search Suggestions Available, Search/Geocode completed, Route calculated |
| `MapViewController` | Mode Changed |

#### Implementation

Components register interest in a notification by calling an **observe** function and providing a callback block. That block will be called when the notification is received, and is passed strongly typed parameters from the notification.

These static **observe** functions are named `MapsAppNotifications.observeXYZNotification()` (where `XYZ` is the notification). Components call them to register their interest in that notification without needing to know the details of how that notification is implemented.

Notification types are declared using Swift Extensions on the `MapsAppNotifications` class (in this case the Login/Logout notifications):

```swift
// From LoginNotifications.swift

extension MapsAppNotifications {
    static func observeLoginStateNotifications(owner:Any,
                                               loginHandler:((AGSPortalUser)->Void)?,
                                               logoutHandler:(()->Void)?) {
        ...
    }
}
```

To be notified of login/logout events, simply call `MapsAppNotifications.observeLoginStateNotifications()` passing blocks that handle the login and logout events.

```swift
func setupLoginNotificationHandlers() {
    MapsAppNotifications.observeLoginStateNotifications(owner: self,
        loginHandler: { [weak self] _ in
            self?.setDisplayForLoginStatus()
        },
        logoutHandler: { [weak self] in
            self?.setDisplayForLoginStatus()
        })
}

deinit {
    MapsAppNotifications.deregisterNotificationBlocks(forOwner: self)
}
```

This pattern turns Apple's _stringly_-typed NSNotification implementation into something _strongly_-typed. This has the following benefits:

* Auto-complete makes it easier to determine available notifications while coding.
* Interested parties' callback blocks are simpler:
  * The Notification's `userInfo` dictionary has already been parsed into strongly typed parameters and is never exposed.
  * No boilerplate is required for the observer.
  * The observer doesn't need to worry about the source of the notification.
  * Notification handlers are easier to write and understand --> Fewer bugs.

**Note:** In the above snippet, `deinit` is defined to clear out any observed handler blocks. You should include this `deinit` block on any class that
makes use of the `MapsAppNotification.observeYZNotification(owner, handlers)` pattern.

#### Example: handling search results

The MapViewController registers its interest in search results with this code:

```swift
// From MapViewController+SearchSetup.swift

MapsAppNotifications.observeSearchNotifications(owner: self,
                                  searchResultHandler: { [weak self] result in
    if let result = result {
        self?.mode = .geocodeResult(result)
    }
})
```

When a search completes, the `ArcGISService` singleton posts the appropriate notification which triggers the above block.

The definition of `observerSearchNotifications()` declares `result` in the above block as an `AGSGeocodeResult`:

```swift
static func observeSearchNotifications(owner: Any,
                                       searchResultHandler:@escaping ((AGSGeocodeResult?)->Void),
                                       suggestionsAvailableHandler:(([AGSSuggestResult]?)->Void)? = nil)
```

So, when `self.mode` is updated in the block above, it in turn posts a `ModeChange` notification:

```swift
// From MapViewController

var mode:MapViewMode = .none {
    didSet {
        updateMapViewForMode()

        // Announce that the mode has changed (the Feedback Panel UI listens to this)
        MapsAppNotifications.postModeChangeNotification(oldMode: oldValue, newMode: mode)
    }
}
```

When first loaded, `FeedbackViewController` registers for `ModeChange` notifications with the following, which allows it to respond to the `ModeChange` notification posted by the `MapViewController` above:

```swift
// From FeedbackViewController

MapsAppNotifications.observeModeChangeNotification(owner: self) { [weak self] oldMode, newMode in
    self?.setUIForMode(mode: newMode, previousMode: oldMode)
}
```

The net result is that when the `ArcGISService` singleton completes a search, `MapViewController.mode` is updated, which in turn updates the `FeedbackViewController`, even though no one object knows about the others.

At no point did the code need to know what the notification's name was nor how to unpack the `userInfo` dictionary and cast its content to `AGSGeocodeResult` or `MapViewMode` as this was all implemented in the `observe` and `post` functions, clearing up the calling code to focus solely on application logic.

### Using the app

The app operates in one of 3 "modes":

* Searching
* Display a Geocode Result
* Display a Route Result

The app allows a user to sign in to ArcGIS Online or an ArcGIS Portal. The user must sign in to browse their account's Web Maps and get route directions (which consumes credits).

If the user's organization or Portal has custom basemaps configured, when signed in, the user will be able to pick from those in the Basemap picker, but otherwise will see just the default ArcGIS Online basemaps.

#### User interface

The main UI component is the Feedback View at the top of the Map View. It reflects the current mode and can be a SearchBar, a Geocode Result, or a Directions Result.

![App Modes](/docs/images/app-modes.png)

* To search, type into the Search Bar.
* To reverse geocode, tap and hold on the map to bring up a magnifying glass and fine-tune a position to look up. Release to reverse geocode.
* To get directions, tap the directions button in the search result panel.

The controls at the bottom right are as follows:

| Icon | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| ![GPS Tracking](/docs/images/control-gps.png) | Cycle through GPS re-centering modes. |
| ![Basemap Picker](/docs/images/control-basemaps.png) | Display a basemap picker. |
| ![Account View](/docs/images/control-account.png) | Display the Account Items viewer. |

The app maintains a history of Search/Geocode/Reverse Geocode/Directions results and displays a `Previous` and `Next` button to browse through them if appropriate. You can also shake the device to initiate the iOS undo/redo behavior.

| Icon | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| ![Previous Result](/docs/images/control-prev-result.png) | View the previous result. |
| ![Next Result](/docs/images/control-next-result.png) | View the next result. |
